            <p>WE’VE GOT TO be honest, you guys; the Internet this week has been all about the aftermath of the Paris attacks, and for good reason. We know we spent the first couple of days after the attacks trying to read up on anything and everything related to the subject, devouring liveblogs of the latest news and trying to sift through gossip and misinformation on Twitter to find out what really happened, and we weren’t alone.

            <p>Unsurprisingly, such a move was catnip to the Internet at large, prompting many reports, too few of which acknowledged that Facebook is supposed to help with ex-stalking, not make it harder.</p>
